# Project Title
 
Miniproject 2 - Insurance Data Visualization with Pandas & Matplotlib
 
## Description
 
This project analyzes an insurance dataset using Pandas and visualizes trends with Matplotlib.
The program answers a few basic questions:

* How do insurance charges differ between smokers and non-smokers?

* Do average charges differ between males and females?

* Is there any relationship between a personâ€™s age and BMI?

Three charts are generated and automatically saved in the charts/ folder when you run the program:

* **Boxplot**: Insurance charges for smokers vs. non-smokers

* **Bar chart**: Average insurance charges by gender

* **Scatter plot**: Relationship between age and BMI

## Getting Started
 
### Dependencies

* Install the required Python packages using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Download the CSV file from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mosapabdelghany/medical-insurance-cost-dataset)
 
### Executing program

```
python main.py
```
